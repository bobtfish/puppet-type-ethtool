##Overview

This module enables you to set settings on your ethernet interfaces using the ethtool command.

##Setup

You must turn pluginsync on to use this module as it is implemented as a custom type and provider

###What type-ethtool affects

* This module will only call the ethtool utility, so will only affect settings on already
  configured network interfaces. It **will not** adjust the settings which interfaces are
  brought up with.

* This can be **DANGEROUS** you can use this module to break the networking on your servers.

###Beginning with type-ethtool

  ethtool { 'eth0':
     .. put options here ..
  }

## Type Usage

Example usage with the most commonly used options:

  ethtool { 'eth0':
    speed            => '100',
    duplex           => 'full',
    tso              => 'disabled',
    autonegotiate_tx => 'disabled',
    autonegotiate_rx => 'disabled',
  }

## Class Usage

You can use the puppet *class* to (optionally) install ethtool for your,
and enforce ordering so that the ethtool *type* is only used after
the ethtool package is available:

    include ethtool

For when you don't want it to install ethtool for you:

    class { 'ethtool': ensure_installed => false }

### All supported properties

Note that not all interfaces support the querying or setting of all of these properties!
Which settings and properties are available will depend on your ethernet card and driver!

#### speed

The speed of the interface: auto/10/100/1000. Note that not all speeds are supported on every interface

#### duplex

If duplex transmission should be enabled on the interface. Possible values are full half or auto.

#### tso

If TCP segment offload is enabled or disabled for this interface

#### lro

Specifies whether large receive offload should be enabled or disabled

#### ufo

Specifies whether UDP fragmentation offload should be enabled or disabled

#### gso

Specifies whether generic segmentation offload should be enabled

#### gro

Specifies whether generic receive offload should be enabled

#### sg

Specifies whether scatter_gather should be enabled

#### checksum_rx

Specifies whether RX checksumming should be enabled

#### checksum_tx

Specifies whether TX checksumming should be enabled

#### autonegotiate

If autonegotiation (PAUSE frames) are enabled or disabled

#### autonegotiate_tx

If autonegotiation is enabled or disabled for transmitting

#### autonegotiate_rx

If autonegotiation is enabled or disabled for receiving

##Limitations

Only works on Linux.

Currently only manages a (small) subset of the whole ethtool functionality.

Doesn't support puppet resource querying of resource state.

Doesn't cache properties or use the flush interface, so makes one call to ethtool per property..

##Development

This module works for what it does, but will not fulfil everyone's needs.
